# Sanp's dotfiles

This is my dotfiles directory. It's a pretty standard one.

## OS

mac

## Installation

Clone the repository into your `${HOME}` folder. Then, go into the dotfiles
folder, and run the install script.

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/sanp/dotfiles.git
cd ~/dotfiles
./install.sh
```

Restart your terminal and vim. Then open vim and run `:PlugInstall`. If all went
well, you should now have access to all of the settings.

## Uninstalling

Go into the `~/dotfiles` folder and run the uninstall script.

```bash
cd ~/dotfiles
./uninstall.sh
