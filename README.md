# Sanp's dotfiles

This is my dotfiles directory. It's a pretty standard one.

## Installation

Clone the repository into your home folder. Then, make the install script
executable and run it.

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/sanp/dotfiles.git
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

Restart your terminal and vim. If all went well, you should now have access to
all of the settings.

## Uninstalling

Go into the `~/dotfiles` folder, make the uninstall script executable, and run
it.

```bash
cd ~/dotfiles
chmod +x uninstall.sh
./uninstall.sh
```
