# Sanp's dotfiles

This is my dotfiles directory. It's a pretty standard one.

## Installation

Clone the repository into your home folder. Then, go into the dotfiles folder, 
and run the install script.

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/sanp/dotfiles.git
cd ~/dotfiles
./install.sh
```

Restart your terminal and vim. If all went well, you should now have access to
all of the settings.

## Uninstalling

Go into the `~/dotfiles` folder and run the uninstall script.

```bash
cd ~/dotfiles
./uninstall.sh
```
