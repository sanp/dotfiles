# Workaround script for installing older python versions.
#
# Pyenv will fail when installing python versions < 3.6 with the following error
# message:
#
#   ERROR: The Python ssl extension was not compiled. Missing the OpenSSL lib?
#
# This script is a workaround for that. Taken from:
# https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/issues/993. To install python versions lower
# than 3.6, source this script before running the install:
#
#   source ~/.env_exporter
#   pyenv install -v 2.7.13
